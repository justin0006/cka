Static provisioning 

Storage class is use to integrate with external drives eg  azure blob, ebd. omn premises in K8s cluster

CSI drivers is disk Storage and File Storage
Disk s is available for one node. and file s will be available for all nodes

K get sc //will list all storage class

k edit sc namehere //its a pod you will more info

k edit sc default

k edit sc azurefile ///this is file s

==>>Static provisioning is first persistent vol is created then PVc persistent vol claim and then map inside the container
==>>Dynamic provisioning first pvc is created then it mapped with container and automatically  persistent vol is created in background => pvc is accessible in Namespace only

Filesystem Its mounted into pods into a directory
Block use a vol as a raw Block device

lets write our dynamic provisioning
mkdir /data, cd data, touch pvc1.yaml, deployment.yaml
type notepad.yaml  //it will open in notepad as well


accessmode are: RWO-mounted a s read, write once   //for block storage  
                ROX-mounted as a read only by many
                RWX- mounted as read write by many
eg: RWX will map the persistent vol to the multiple worker nodes
only file s will support above


k apply -f pvc1.yaml
k get pvc

Now we need to create a pod and mapped it

K create deployment login --image=httpd --dry-run -o yaml >  deployment.yaml
vi deployment.yaml
//at bottom we need to write
     
   mountpoint: /
  Volumes: 
   -name: v1
   persistentVolumeClaim;
     Claim: pvc1

     done now pv is created automatically blob storage
